Abhijit learns to python! 


1.py : The code contains simple commands such as print and input(), which takes an input from he console.
2.py : Shows use of "if" statements
3.py : The code gets more advanced with continuous "While TRUE" statements, "try", "except" error handlers
4.py : A guessing game. First real milestone of my journey where I take an input from user, compare it to the randomly generated value and give users six attempts to guess the number. I have used "Import Random", "Randint", "for" loops, "if" statements to create this program.
